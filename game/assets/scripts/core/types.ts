 * Which end of the ring a feeder channel joins, named by PIPELINE LENGTH rather than by

 * not interchangeable: a row entering at `near` reaches the boarding gap in capacity/4
 * ticks, one entering at `far` takes three times that. That difference is the difficulty
 * knob this milestone turns, and `left`/`right` hid it. The view draws no left/right
 * mapping at all: both position and heading come from the entry cell's own path point
 * and outward normal (see `entryIndex` in track-path.ts and `TrackView.buildLanes`),
 * which is what makes a tilted shape's channels tilt correctly with no special-casing.
